                <p>When I decided to create my personal website, I wanted to explore how modern AI tools could streamline the development process. Using a combination of ChatGPT and Claude, I was able to build this entire website from scratch, learning valuable lessons along the way.</p>
            </section>

            <section class="post-content">
                <h2>Getting Started with AI-Assisted Development</h2>
                <p>My journey began with a simple prompt to Claude: "Help me create a personal website." What followed was a fascinating collaboration between human creativity and artificial intelligence, where I learned that AI could not only generate code but also help with design decisions and problem-solving.</p>

                <h2>The Development Process</h2>
                <p>The website was built iteratively, with AI helping at each stage:</p>

                <pre><code>
// Example of AI-suggested navigation component
const Navigation = () => {
    return (
        <nav className="main-nav">
            <div className="nav-container">
                <Logo />
                <MenuItems />
            </div>
        </nav>
    );
};</code></pre>

                <h2>Key Learnings</h2>
                <p>Throughout this process, I discovered several important insights about AI-assisted development:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>AI excels at generating boilerplate code and suggesting best practices</li>
                    <li>It's crucial to verify and understand the code AI generates</li>
                    <li>AI can be an excellent learning tool for understanding modern web development concepts</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Challenges Faced</h2>
                <p>While AI was incredibly helpful, it wasn't without its challenges. Sometimes the generated code needed refinement, and occasionally the AI would suggest outdated practices. This highlighted the importance of maintaining a balance between AI assistance and human oversight.</p>

            <section class="post-conclusion">
                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <p>Building this website with AI assistance has been an enlightening experience. It demonstrated that AI tools can significantly accelerate the development process while still allowing for personal creativity and learning. As AI continues to evolve, I'm excited to see how it will further transform web development.</p>
